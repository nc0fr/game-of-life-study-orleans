# `@life2/game`

[`@life2/game`][pkg] is a JavaScript implementation of the Life2 simulation
game made to work on V8-compatible runtime, including [Node.js][nodejs],
[Bun][bun], and standard Web browsers.

The Life2 simulation game is a cellular automaton software following the same
aspect as the traditional [Conway's Game of Life][gol], except it separates
cells in two teams (so called "groups" or "societies").
The principal objectives behind Life2 is to analyze the behavior of societies
given the rules we defined for them: *how does members of a same society
interact with each other (growth, death, ...)?* *How do two society can live
together when they are different and live in a world where the rules encourage
one to takeover the other?*
